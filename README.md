The purpose of my final project was to provide information about pests/vectors of the Texas Panhandle.
My hope was to build a database that could be accessed by anyone. I also envisioned medical personnel
uploading information to better understand the prevalence of disease spreading arthropods. My project
was refactored a few times but it did not get to the point I had hoped. I admit the testing portion 
of my project was lacking as well as the ORM portion.
